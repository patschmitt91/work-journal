# Code Standards

This project follows specific code standards to maintain consistency and professionalism.

## No Emojis Policy

Do not use emojis in:
- Source code files (.ts, .tsx, .js, .jsx)
- Code comments
- Function/variable names
- Commit messages
- Pull request descriptions
- Issues and discussions

Use clear, descriptive text instead.

## Why No Emojis?

- Professionalism: Code should be formal and professional
- Compatibility: Not all systems/terminals render emojis correctly
- Searchability: Text is easier to search and grep than emojis
- Accessibility: Screen readers may not handle emojis well
- Consistency: Plain text is universally understood

This project includes:
- `.editorconfig` - Editor configuration for consistent formatting
- `.vscode/settings.json` - VS Code specific settings
